# Greetings, Mortals.

I'm the Wi-Fi Necromancer, a wireless network engineer by day and a sorcerer of code by night. I've been known to raise some seriously undead Wi-Fi connections that would make even the Grim Reaper jealous.

### My Grimoire 📚

I've spent years studying the dark arts of Wi-Fi magic, and I've amassed a powerful grimoire filled with incantations that would send shivers down even the most experienced hacker's spine:

* Curse of Latency: With this spell, I can make your Wi-Fi so slow that you'll swear you're using a dial-up connection from the '90s.
* Hex of Packet Loss: Need to lose some packets? Say no more. This hex will make sure your Wi-Fi drops more packets than a clumsy necromancer dropping bones.
* Dark Incantation of Interference: Want to disrupt your neighbor's Wi-Fi signal? This incantation will send an unholy wave of interference their way, causing chaos and confusion.

### My Feline Familiars 🐱🐱🐱
When I'm not raising the dead, I'm hanging out with my trusty enchanting companions - Cleo, Pipsqueak, and Oreo. They might not be the most obedient minions, but they sure are good at keeping me company while I practice my dark arts.

### My Quest 🗺️
My ultimate quest is to create a Wi-Fi network so powerful and malevolent that it can bring the entire world to its knees. With my skills and knowledge, I'm confident that I can make this dark dream a reality.
